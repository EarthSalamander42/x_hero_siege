// "tutorial_power_balance_01"			"Often you will find yourself desperate, as your enemies grow stronger and stronger, and you are confined to your own base. Worry not, however, for not all is lost!"
// "tutorial_power_balance_02"			"\nThe ancients' enmity is old, and the balance of their emissaries' power cannot be tipped easily. You will find that, the weaker your own team is, the greater the rewards will be for slaying your opposition."
// "tutorial_power_balance_03"			"\nEven when one of your allies cowardly abandons the battlefield, worry not, for the Ancient's rage will only be fueled further, granting you and your remaining teammates even greater rewards when killing an enemy."
// "tutorial_power_balance_04"			"\nBe wary, however, as the opposing ancient is just as crafty and full of tricks. Sometimes, a swift and decisive victory may be easier to achieve than a drawn-out, rollercoaster ride of a win."
